To create a sql database schema, I first need to decide what sort of schema to build. 

It should model the one-to-many or many-to-many relationships that are possible. 

I will also try to keep it simple for now. I should practice advanced queries separately and maybe sql functions. 

A simple example of many-many and 1-many:

A sheet of paper with a to-do list written on it can have multiple tasks on it. This is one-many. 

A given recipe on the internet can list many foods in it. But, a particular food may be in multiple recipes. This is many-many.

in this example:
'I am trying to get a basic rails application running that helps capture the nutritional information of each food item from a list of food items. The nutritional information is stored per ingredient and calculated as the sum of individual ingredients.'



going through this tutorial below using the above as personal example:
https://www.sqlshack.com/learn-sql-create-database-create-table/

recipe
	ingredient
		nutritional info
		nutritional info
	ingredient
		nutritional info
		nutritional info
recipe
	ingredient
		nutritional info
		nutritional info
	ingredient
		nutritional info
		nutritional info
recipe
	ingredient
		nutritional info
		nutritional info
	ingredient
		nutritional info
		nutritional info

a single recipe has multiple ingredients
a single ingredient will show up in multiple recipes
(many-many)

a single ingredient will have various nutritional info
(one-many)

I think this will have a normalized database. 










todo for later reading:
'has many through' relationship
